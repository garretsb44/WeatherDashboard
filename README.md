Weather dashboard for searched cities with five-day forecasts and uv index

Description:

I have created an application that allows the user to search for cities in the U.S. to access some features of the weather report. The users saved cities get saved and in local storage.  If the user refreshes the page all events are saved in local console and the user can still access past cities.  The application also gives a 5 day forecast for the user. The application will help users plan their day for resulting weather.  This application helped me as a develop a better understanding of javascript,jquery, and api's.
